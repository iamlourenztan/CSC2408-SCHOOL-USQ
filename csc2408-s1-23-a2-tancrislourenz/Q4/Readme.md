# Readme for A2-Task4

This directory will need to contain your shell script
and your markdown (.md) file.

Note that the markdown file, when rendered, should look
similar to the PDF file that is provided in this directory.
It is acknowledged that it will not look 100% similar; for
example, centering, table rows lines etc will look different.
