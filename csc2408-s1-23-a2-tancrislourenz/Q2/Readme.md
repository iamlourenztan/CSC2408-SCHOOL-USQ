# Readme for A2-Task2

This directory will need to contain your bash script.

----

The directories ~/dailyingest , ~/shortvideos  etc
SHOULD NOT be included in your git repository.  These
are in a different part of your file system.

For example, if you use the Course VM, your directory
strucure may look like:

~/a2repo
~/dailyingest
~/shortvideos
~/badfiles

(where ~ correspondes to /home/usqstudent)

Only the ~/a2repo directory will contain your Assignment 2
files.

----

Note that your repo will be cloned by the marker onto 
their own machine, into a directory structure that is 
likely different.  So your script should ensure that 
paths are relative, not absolute.

----

You may *optionally* include a number of test files in your 
repo that you've used to test the correct functioning of your 
script.
These files should be very small text files (only containing
a few words); they SHOULD NOT be actual video files, even
though their names end in ".mp4"
