# Readme for Assignment 2

The files in this ZIP file should be extracted to the directory
in which you cloned your A2 git repo.  This is also where you'll
do your assignment work.

Then these files should be added to the staging area, and then
committed into the repository.

That commit should then be pushed to the remote (USQ Gitea).

------

The directories Q2...Q5 map to Task 2...Task 5 in the assignment
specification.
